# IoT Based Multi-Purpose Unmanned Surface Vehicles for Surveillance and Rescue Operations

### This project “Multi-Purpose Unmanned Surface Vehicles for Surveillance and Rescue Operations” using domain of Internet of Things (IoT) is used mainly in Defense and Rescue purpose. This will help provide better security and surveillance capabilities to our Sea borders and restrict unauthorized infiltration attempts. It may also be used to save lives in case of a natural disaster.

### Overview: Disaster robotics has become a research area in its own right .Most of these disaster deployments use aerial, ground, or underwater robotic platforms.However, the research involving autonomous boats or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) for Disaster Management (DM) is currently spread across several publications .Our project attempts to explore the possibility of designing and implementing an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in form of a Boat with a Surveillance Camera installed for search and rescue operations at Water bodies. This USV can be controlled over the internet using concepts of Internet of Things.

### Design: The design of this Unmanned Surface Vehicle resembles that of a Speed Boat. The boat has a high-power DC motor coupled with a propeller to provide thrust. The direction of this thrust vector is controlled by a rudder. The rudder is rotated at a specific angle based on the signals provided by the main microcontroller board with the help of a servo motor.  The power system of this USV consists of a pack of Li-Ion batteries . There is also an array of solar panels responsible for charging the batteries and provide long duration.
